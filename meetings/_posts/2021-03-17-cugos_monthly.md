**[Jonny Kemp](https://github.com/clubkemp)** Will talk about mapping his way through the country. Part expose of the trip, part inspiration for a better journaling platform centered around travel, part thoughts going beyond. We'll look at the hacked together [v1 of the map](https://clubkemp.com/travelmap/#5/40.234/-94.517), using Qgis and the qgis2web pluging,  and maybe check out some fun photos. With this genesis in mind, let's peak at an MVP of what a [v2 of the platform](https://wandir-front.herokuapp.com/7/dashboard) could look like. Maybe spitball some spinoffs, refinements, etc?
